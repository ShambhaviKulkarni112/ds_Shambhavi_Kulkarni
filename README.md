   👉 [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShambhaviKulkarni112/ds_Shambhavi_Kulkarni/blob/main/notebook_1.ipynb)  

2. Run all cells.  
   - The notebook loads, cleans, and merges the datasets.  
   - It performs EDA, per-account analysis, and sentiment-based performance checks.  
   - Outputs are saved into `csv_files/` and `outputs/`.

- **Per-Account Behavior**: A few top accounts contribute disproportionately to total PnL.  
- **Trade Size vs Sentiment**: Trade sizes are generally larger during “Greed” periods.  
- **Risk/Leverage**: (if leverage available) higher leverage clusters on optimistic (Greed) days.  
- **Recommendations**: Build sentiment-aware trading strategies and risk controls.
